# 102-flowers-classfication-with-PyTorch
A detailed step-by-step walk-through for PyTorch based computer vision & deep learning beginners

@What<br>
Using the VGG 102 flowers dataset (provided in the project) to perform simple image classification with pre-trained VGG19 backbone.

@Why<br>
This is a tutorial-like project which is deliberatively practiced for beginners to follow.

@Details<br>
--- > Using PyTorch 0.4.1 + Python3.7 + Cuda9.0 (With specific cpu & gpu switch utils)<br>
--- > train_eval, test, predict, checkpoint_save & load, and image_preprossessing functionaliteis are wrapped in functions for easy reuse.<br>
--- > Offers a Jupyter Notebook version and a .py plain file version.<br>

@Additoinals<br>
--- > A self-written handbook for obsolute Linux & Python & PyTorch new-comers, containing some tips that have made my life easier when I first started.
