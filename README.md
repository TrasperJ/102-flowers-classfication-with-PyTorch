# 102-flowers-classfication-with-PyTorch
A detailed step-by-step walk-through for PyTorch based computer vision & deep learning beginners

@What<br>
Using the 102-flowers dataset (provided in the project) to perform simple image classification with pre-trained VGG19 backbone.

@Why<br>
This is a tutorial-like project which is deliberatively practiced for beginners to follow.

@Details<br>
-> Using PyTorch 0.4.1 + Python3.7 + Cuda9.0 (With specific cpu & gpu switch utils)<br>
-> 102-flowers dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/wassimseifeddine/102flowersdataset/downloads/102flowersdataset.zip/1
-> train_eval,test,predict,chkpt_save & load,and image_preprossess functionaliteis are wrapped in functions for easy reuse.<br>
-> Offers a Jupyter Notebook version and a .py plain file version.<br>
