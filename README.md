# 102-flowers-classfication-with-PyTorch
A detailed step-by-step walk-through for PyTorch based computer vision & deep learning beginners

@ What is this project<br>
Using the 102-flowers dataset (provided in the project) to perform simple image classification with pre-trained VGG19 backbone.

@ Why go through this project<br>
This is a tutorial-like project which is deliberatively practiced for beginners to follow.

@ Details info to use this repo<br>
-> Using PyTorch 0.4.1 + Python3.7 + Cuda9.0 (With specific cpu & gpu switch utils)<br>
<br>
-> 102-flowers dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/wassimseifeddine/102flowersdataset/downloads/102flowersdataset.zip/1<br>
once downloaded, unzip into your project directory and making sure it is named as './flowers'. <br>
Going into ./flowers/, it should contains the /train, /valid. /test subdirectories. Keep them unchanged.<br>
<br>
-> train_eval,test,predict,chkpt_save & load,and image_preprossess functionaliteis are wrapped in functions for easy reuse.<br>
<br>
-> Offers a Jupyter Notebook version and a .py plain file version.<br>

@ Additional handbook of tips <br>
-> A self-collected tips for obsolute new-comers to Jupyter notebook, which have made my life easier when I first started. <br>

-> A self-collected tips for obsolute new-comers to Linux OS & PyTorch. (Still in-progress, accmulating tips that have really helped me.)
