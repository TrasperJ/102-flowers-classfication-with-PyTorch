# 102-flowers-classfication-with-PyTorch
A detailed step-by-step walk-through for PyTorch based computer vision & deep learning beginners

@What<br>
Using the VGG 102 flowers dataset to perform simple image classification with pre-trained VGG19 backbone.

@Why
This is a tutorial-like project which is deliberatively practiced for beginners to follow.

@How
--- > Using PyTorch 0.4.1 + Python3.7 + Cuda9.0 (With specific cpu & gpu switch utils)
--- > train_eval, test, predict, checkpoint_save & load, and image_preprossessing functionaliteis are wrapped in functions for easy reuse.
--- > Offers a Jupyter Notebook version and a .py plain file version
